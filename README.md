ZuluSCSI Ultra Wide OSHW
========================

ZuluSCSI Ultra Wide is an Open Source Hardware design, originally derived from George Mezzomo's (incomplete) [RP2350B-based GBSCSI2 wide board]([url](https://github.com/GeorgeRudolf/GBSCSI2/tree/main/rp2350_HD68_3.5))

Numerous small improvements to routing, pinouts, and power circuitry have been made. 

Please note that the earlier GBSCSI2 Wide design that this design is derived from  will_ not work with unmodified ZuluSCSI firmware_ as-is, so unless you really know what you're doing, use this design instead.
