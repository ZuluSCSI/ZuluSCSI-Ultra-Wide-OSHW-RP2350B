ZuluSCSI™ Ultra Wide OSHW - Community Edition - Open Source Hardware
========================

This repository contains the KiCAD 9 schematic and PCB design files for an Open Source Hardware variant of the RP2350B-based ZuluSCSI™ SCSI to SD storage emulator, derived from George Mezzomo's incomplete-at-time-of-forking [RP2350B-based GBSCSI2 wide board](https://github.com/GeorgeRudolf/GBSCSI2/tree/main/rp2350_HD68_3.5). 

Numerous small improvements to routing, pinouts, expansion headers, and power circuitry have been made. As always, firmware for ZuluSCSI is available at http://github.com/ZuluSCSI/ZuluSCSI-firmware
